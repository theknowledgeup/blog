Hello Parita,

I am an undergraduate student pursuing Computer Science and Engineering at Guru Nanak Dev Engg. Clg, Ludhiana. A coding and Linux enthusiast who wants to learn as many things as possible. A FOSS lover and an open source contributor. &nbsp;

I have participated in Google Summer of Code 2017 with AboutCode and prepared a server using Django Rest Framework. PostgreSQL database was in the app. You can find more about my GSoC at the following link.

You can find more about me on my website which is in the signature below. I have developed a recent project on Django: http://jeklog.com.

I would be greatful if you provide me the opportunity to be the part of your organisation.

Ranvir Singh,
